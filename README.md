## Introduction to Synchronization in Automation
Synchronization in automation testing is essential for ensuring that your automation scripts run in sync with the application. It helps ensure that WebDriver interacts with web elements only after they are ready for interaction.

## Understanding Synchronization Problems
- Synchronization problems occur when the speed of the application is slower than the execution speed of the automation script.
- These issues can cause WebDriver to fail in interacting with elements because they arenâ€™t yet loaded or ready for interaction.
  
## WebDriver Waiting Methods
WebDriver provides various waiting methods to handle synchronization problems. These methods ensure that automation scripts wait for elements to be in a ready state before interacting with them.

### Implicit Wait
- Implicit wait is an easy way to handle synchronization problems by specifying a maximum wait time. If an element is not found immediately, WebDriver will keep checking for it until the specified time is reached.
- By default, implicit wait is applied to all elements in the WebDriver instance.

Example:
```java
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
